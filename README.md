# GravityEnergy System

The GravityEnergy System is a sophisticated energy-efficient setup designed to harness gravitational forces for mechanical energy extraction. The system consists of a robust cylinder containing a massive sphere, which is free to rotate within the cylinder. This assembly is meticulously tilted to its critical angle, a specific inclination that optimizes energy dynamics.

## Critical Angle

The critical angle is the precise tilt at which the gravitational force acting on the sphere is perfectly balanced with the normal force from the cylinder's surface. Operating at this angle offers several advantages:

- **Energy Efficiency**: Minimal external energy is required to maintain the cylinder's rotation at the critical angle, reducing overall energy consumption.
- **Optimized Energy Gain**: The sphere's kinetic energy is maximized at this angle, allowing for significant energy extraction with minimal input.
- **System Stability**: Maintaining the critical angle ensures stable and consistent motion of the sphere, preventing erratic behavior and enhancing system reliability.

## Operational Mechanism

When the cylinder rotates at the critical angle, the massive sphere gains substantial kinetic energy due to the gravitational pull and the system's rotational dynamics. A generator rotor arm is strategically placed in the sphere's path to tap into this kinetic energy. By extracting only a portion of the sphere's energy during each rotation, the system ensures continuous motion without depleting the sphere's momentum.

## Key Features

- **Minimal Energy Input**: The system requires very little external energy to sustain rotation, thanks to the balance achieved at the critical angle.
- **High Energy Output**: The massive sphere stores a significant amount of kinetic energy, which can be efficiently converted into electrical energy through the rotor arm.
- **Self-Sustaining Loop**: A portion of the extracted energy is recycled back into the system to maintain the cylinder's rotation, creating an efficient and sustainable energy loop.

## Advantages

- **Sustainability**: Reduces reliance on fossil fuels by providing a renewable energy source.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Low energy input and high energy output make the system economically viable.
- **Scalability**: The design can be scaled to accommodate different energy requirements and applications.
- **Reliability**: Stable operation at the critical angle ensures long-term functionality with minimal maintenance.

**Note**: The complete description and diagrams of the system are included in the code repository for further clarification.
