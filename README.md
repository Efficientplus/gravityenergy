# Gravity Energy
Harnessing Gravity for Sustainable Power Solutions

## Description
Gravity Energy is an innovative renewable energy system harnessing gravity to generate clean, scalable power for homes and industries. Designed exclusively for *non-commercial* and *non-military use*, it provides an eco-friendly solution to meet sustainable energy needs without harming the environment. Empowering individuals and communities with accessible green energy technology.

## Features
- *Sustainable*: Utilizes gravity, a limitless natural force.
- *Scalable*: Suitable for both residential and industrial applications.
- *Eco-Friendly*: Minimal environmental impact.
- *Cost-Effective*: Reduces energy costs over time.

## How It Works
Gravity Energy harnesses the gravitational force through a series of weighted mechanisms and kinetic systems to generate electricity. The system is designed to operate continuously with minimal maintenance, providing a reliable source of power.

## Installation and Usage
1. *Setup Components*: Assemble the weighted mechanisms as per the design diagrams.
2. *Connect Systems*: Integrate the kinetic systems with the power generation units.
3. *Activate*: Start the system and monitor the power output through the interface.
